# Report Week 2/16/20
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
* tested out various techniques with several models to navigate the maze
* finally got a model to successfully navigate the maze!
  * unfortunately had to implement memory of 1 timestep
  * if previous move was left, don't go right and vice versa
  * worked on one of the older models I had trained
* trained a regression model, trying to predict angle to turn from -90 to 90 degrees
  * the idea was that the loss function would allow it to learn difference between left and right better and would smooth the predictions
  * worked fairly well in maze when using memory of 1 timestep (almost made it all the way)
  * when trained on dataset with only exact turns and moving straight down the corridors, it did much better than any other model trained on the same dataset
## Issues/Problems
* None
## Plans
* make changes to AutoRand.py to decrease level of noise
  * it seems that models trained on AutoRand.py were suffering from too noisy data as opposed to left/right problem that other models were having trouble with
* finish trying out regression model
  * train on better dataset from AutoRand.py with less noise than extremely noisy data, but more resemblant of the space of images than rigid data
