# Report Week 2/16/20
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
* tested out various techniques with several models to navigate the maze
* finally got a model to successfully navigate the maze!
  * unfortunately had to implement memory of 1 timestep
  * if previous move was left, don't go right and vice versa
* began training a regression model, trying to predict angle to turn from -90 to 90 degrees
  * hopefully this loss function will allow it to learn difference between left and right better
## Issues/Problems
* Did not have a lot of time to work this week since I was participating in the H4BL event
## Plans
* make changes to AutoRand.py to decrease level of noise
  * it seems that models trained on AutoRand.py were suffering from too noisy data as opposed to left/right problem that other models were having trouble with
* finish trying out regression model
