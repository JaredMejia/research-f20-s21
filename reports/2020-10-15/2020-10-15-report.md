# Report Week 10/15/20
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
 * finished lesson 3 of the fastai course
   * I learned a lot about the different ways machine learning can be dangerous for society
   * I learned how to be thoroughly invested in prioritizing safety/privacy/ethics in order to prevent damage later on
   * preventing negatively impactful models requires a lot of preparation and conscious decision making and ignorance can lead to such models
 * [did some data scraping and image classification model training](https://console.paperspace.com/tewx81sfd/notebook/prl2qabhq)
   * classifying elephants vs hippos vs rhinos (4.65% error rate)
   * classifying cheetah vs leopard vs jaguar-cat (12.94% error rate)
     * used 'jaguar-cat' since 'jaguar' resulted in a bunch of cars
   * lessons learned
     * gained a lot of practice using `DataLoaders`, `cnn_learner`, and other classes/functions from the fast.ai library
     * learned how to scrape images from the internet and prepare them to be used for training an image classification model
     * practiced cleaning image data using the fastai library
     * practiced augmenting data for training
     * was able to choose optimal number of epochs to prevent overfitting by monitoring the validation loss and training loss simultaneously
     * realized that plurality in image search can make a difference!
       * likely would have gained better results if I had used 'elephant' as opposed to 'elephants', etc.
## Issues/Problems
  * The computer came, but I hadn't realized that I might need a wifi adapter
  * I ran into several problems while training my own models which gladly I was able to struggle with and eventually learn from
    * I kept running into the problem of `RuntimeError: DataLoader worker (pid 16560) is killed by signal: Killed`
      * turned out it was due to the fact that I was using a CPU through gradient when what I really needed for the training was a powerful GPU
      * had to create a new notebook on a different machine with Quadro GPU through Gradient, but it worked out!
        * also was having some issues with Gradient and somehow managed to delete my previous notebook (this was 90% my fault) so I had to start from scratch
    * ran into several other problems due to my infamiliarity with the fast.ai library, but eventually was able to figure things out!
  * The results of my models were both fairly underwhelming
    * 4.65% for elephants vs hippos vs rhinos
      * this should have been a fairly easy classification task
      * high error rate perhaps makes sense given my plurality problem
    * 12.95% for cheetah vs leopard vs jaguar-cat
      * this error rate is unacceptably high for most image classification problems
      * granted, most humans wouldn't be able to distinguish between the three cats
    * for both models, there were only 450 total images (150 x 3)
      * given such small datasets, perhaps the results aren't so bad after all
    * looking forward to learning to apply some of the methods for improving training using fast.ai library
## Plans
  * do lesson 4 of the fastai course
  * learn how to tweak hyper-parameters in fast.ai and apply various regularization methods, as well as different cost functions
  * gain more practice working with data and training models
