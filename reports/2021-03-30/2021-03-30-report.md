# Report Week 3/30/21
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
* experimented with various models
  * models using different proportions between turning and straight
    * models with distribution of images exactly from generated data performed the best
* practiced with instance segmentation/masking and object detection in PyTorch
  * UE allows for automatic semantic segmentation
  * using this could empower our robot much more than just three directions
  * could combine this with controller, learned or hard coded
* looked into domain adaptation as a tool for our problem
  * Adversarial based domain adaptation
    * use CoGAN model where pairs of generator/discriminators assigned to source and target distribution
  * Reconstruction-based domain adaptation
    * DRCN classifies source data and reconstructs target data
    * Cycle GANs for training two opposing translators simultaneously
  * we most likely would need real world data for these
* prepared presentation
 
## Issues/Problems
* no issues or problems

## Plans
* meet with Kevin and Professor Clark
* look more into possibility of instance segmentation in Kevin's environment
* read more into domain adaptation to determine whether we can feasibly leverage it
