## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
* finished lesson 2 of fast.ai course
  * [Notes here](https://github.com/JaredMejia/research-fall-20/blob/master/practical-deep-learning-course/lesson-2-production/lesson-2-notes.md)
* walked through process of using model for inference and deploying a model
  * exporting a model (architecture and trained parameters)
  * walked through process of building a simple GUI and web app for model (Voil√† through Jupyter Notebook)
## Issues/Problems
* my microsoft azura free trial expired so I didn't have a chance to web scrape from Bing (following the steps that the course does)
  * however, I can try to build my own image classification model using a different API
* was a busy week of midterms so didn't make as much progress as I would have hoped!
## Plans
* begin/complete lesson 3
* train and deploy my own image classification model
