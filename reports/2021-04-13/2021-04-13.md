# Report Week 3/30/21
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
* read through paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15651](Contrastive Learning for Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation)
  * CUT is supposed to perform as good or even better than CycleGAN with faster training time and higher quality output
* Spent time playing around with CycleGAN in PyTorch
 
## Issues/Problems
* no issues or problems

## Plans
* experiment more with CycleGAN and compare results with CUT on domain adaptation between real and simulation
