## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
* From (MÃ¼ller et al., 2020) I learned about the challenge of label imbalance when training driving policies on autonomous navigation datasets, and was introduced to a novel loss function that solves the problem by weighing the MSE of the steering angle by a factor proportional to the steering angle
* continued with fastai course
  * [Notes on Lesson 2: From Model to Production](https://github.com/JaredMejia/research-fall-20/blob/master/practical-deep-learning-course/lesson-2-production/lesson-2-notes.md)
  * learned about working with data in fastai
    * gained familiarity with `DataLoaders` and `DataLoader` classes
  * learned how to augment data in the form of images in fastai and the best way to do so
  * learned how to clean data by initially training a simple model and then taking a look at the images with the highest lost with fastai
  
## Issues/Problems
* no real problems besides the free GPU taking a little while to start the jupyter notebook
## Plans
* finish lesson 2
* train my own classification model from images scraped from bing image search
* begin lesson 3
## Article Summaries
[OpenBot: Turning Smartphones into Robots](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10631.pdf)
In the paper, the problem of overly expensive robots and the problem of cheap, but ineffective robots is addressed as smartphones are used as the 'brain' of autunomously navigating robots. Imitation learning is used as data is collected initially when the robots are first controlled by remote to navigate an environment. The data is then used for training, the pipeline of which consists of preporcessing of data, normalizing, sampling, augmentation (including removing steering bias by filipping images and labels), and updating the driving policy by optimizing the loss function. The loss function overcomes the challenge of label imbalance, which is a common occurrence when training driving policies on autonomous navigation datasets, by taking into account that the majority of the time the vehicle is driving in a straight line, so nonlinear movements are weighted more heavily. The result is a loss function which adds a weighted term proportional to the steering angle to the mean squared error of the steering angle. The mean squared error of the action vector is also taken into account. 

I believe there is a lot that we can gain from this research paper as we work on our own robot. Specifically, the loss function seems that it would apply in our case in the same way as it did for the robot in the paper. We might also be able to make use of slightly modified version of the dataset collection and training pipeline as the one in the paper.
