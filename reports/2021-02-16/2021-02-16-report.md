# Report Week 2/16/20
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
* Created AutoRand.py, a script to generate images for training the model with added random noise
* generated more than 44,000 images
## Issues/Problems
* was having some trouble with the zip file in my jupyter notebook and so I did not get the chance to train a model on the images yet
## Plans
* train model on new dataset from images generated with random noise
* test model on mazes that weren't used for data collection
