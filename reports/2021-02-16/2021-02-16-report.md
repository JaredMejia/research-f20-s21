# Report Week 2/16/20
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
* Created AutoRand.py, a script to generate images for training the model with added random noise
* generated more than 44,000 images
* trained multiple models on the images
* tested out one of the models, but the model did not do well at navigating the maze
  * most likely a result of too much noise in the image data
## Issues/Problems
* None
## Plans
* clean data of images generated with noise
* make changes to AutoRand.py to decrease level of noise
* try different techniques for applying the model
* perhaps apply some ensemble methods to combine predictions from models trained on different datasets
  * mix models trained on noisy data with models trained on data without noise
