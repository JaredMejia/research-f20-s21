# Report Week 3/02/21
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
* made changes to AutoRand.py to reduce noise in images generated
* trained another regression model on images with decreased noise
  * was able to get model to navigate the maze
  * however, the model seemed prone to turn left for some reason, and so I had to tweak the range of values to convert predictions into moves to balance this out
  * the model that successfully navigate the maze turned left if the angle prediction was greater than 50 degrees, turned right if the angle prediction was less than -20, and went straight otherwise.
  * the model still only worked when I prevented it from turning left if it had just turned right and vice versa
* I realized that something is not working correctly with the AutoRand.py script, but only on one of the mazes it seems.
  * I'm hoping that if I fix this, the model will work much better
## Issues/Problems
* None
## Plans
* need to fix AutoRand.py (or perhaps maze?) and to retrain model afterwards
