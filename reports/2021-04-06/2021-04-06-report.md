# Report Week 3/30/21
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
* read through papers [https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593] (Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation Using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks) , [https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004] (Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03601] (Deep Visual Domain Adaptation), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00976] (Contrastive Adaptation Network for Unsupervised Domain Adapatation), and [https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7495] (Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation).
* Self-SWOT
 
## Issues/Problems
* no issues or problems

## Plans
* tbd, based on discussion with Professor Clark

# SWOT
## Strengths:
* personal strengths
  * eager to learn
  * hardworking
  * curious
  * dedicated
  * constantly asking 'what if?' for different techniques and approaches to our problem
  * reading current, relevant research to gain insight and ideas for our problem
  * growth mindset

* lab strengths
  * good sense of community
  * Prof. Clark is always easy to reach and willing to help
  * we have different people working on a wide array of tasks
  * low-stress, positive environment
  * diverse group of thinkers with varying strengths and areas of interest

## Weaknesses:
* areas where I can improve
  * technical abilities (C++, PyTorch, programming in general etc.)
  * experience and competence with the basic research process (posing questions, studying relevant research literature, etc.)
  * ability in designing algorithms and experiments, creating metrics to measure the success of the experiments and using critical thinking to figure out how to improve the experiments and draw meaningful results from them
  * relating the problem that I am trying to solve to the task at hand, and vice versa
  * thinking outside of the box, coming up with novel approaches to a research problem
  * ability to distinguish between questions that people care about and would be meaningful if answers were found
  * knowledge and skills in the area of Computer Vision
  * knowledge and skills in the area of ML and Neural Networks
  * sustaining a large code base with other contributors while maintaining organization and structure

* areas where the lab can improve
  * Sometimes, it feels like there is a bit of a lack of direction. I think the lab could improve by outlining more clearly our goals, and constantly reevaluating our process in obtaining those goals. It is fairly difficult to measure progress without explicit goals and a well thought out plan.
  * While the informal nature of the lab is nice as it prevents stress from amounting, often I wonder whether such functioning provides an accurate depiction of what I should expect and be prepared for in the future when I (hopefully) join a lab at a larger university. If possible, I would like this lab experience to help me prepare for the labs I will be joining later on in terms of best practices.

* additional thoughts:
  * Though it may not be for the good of science, with PhD applications just around the corner, I cannot help but feel the pressure to successfully publish at least one paper to some conference or journal to include in my application. Even before that, I would like to have a tangible, detailed, and perhaps even narrow, research question to pose and then to work towards answering. I know it is difficult since the lab is so young, but sometimes it feels a bit as if we are in the dark, and I even have trouble explaining the project in its entirety in interviews. 
  * I am very committed to my goal of obtaining a PhD and I am eager to take all of the necessary steps to do so. Sometimes, I partially wish more was demanded of me as an assistant researcher to help me to learn the necessary skills that are required of an actual researcher. I think personally I tend to learn and grow the most when I'm in an environment with very high standards.

## Opportunities
* the lab's opportunities:
  * As the separate pieces of our project seem to be starting to fall in place, it feels like we have a great opportunity ahead to pickup some serious momentum.
  * With Kevin's work in Unreal paired with the photogrammetry, it seems like we will soon be able to generate from a rich environment, useful data for training
  * With Alex and Gabriel's recent work, it feels like we are very close to actualizing the robot!
  * Professor Clark has mentioned various conferences in the future which we can potentially submit our results to
  * Once we are on campus, the different parts of our pipeline will likely be able to interact at a much faster pace, and as a result the throughput of ideas should also speed up
* my personal goals for the next 6 months
  * I hope to make a significant progress over the course of the rest of the school year to help our robot to navigate the Unreal simulation, and experimenting with different techniques and approaches to accomplish this.
  * though I plan focusing primarily on my summer research program over the summer, I would like to still be involved with the project and be consistently making progress (I'm hoping this is legal through Pomona, I wouldn't expect pay).
  * If possible, it would be amazing if we could get to a point where we feel that we have results that are publishable. I want to gain as much experience as possible in writing research papers, so I would love the opportunity play a significant role in communicating our results.

## Threats
* threats to personal success
  * Sometimes I find myself overcommitting to multiple projects. I'm afraid that in doing so I would jeopardize my focus and potential for doing cool and fun things in this project. 
    * Along these lines, I'm currently very conflicted over whether or not to play soccer again for the fall season. It would be an enormous time committment that I didn't have to deal with over the past year, and I'm afraid it would restrain my abilities to do meaningful research, especially in time so close to application season. 
    * Also along these lines, I don't often find myself stressed, but rather overextended and experiencing diminishing marginal returns to my time spent when I make too many commitments
