# Report Week 12/10/20
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
- finished second half of fastai lesson 6 on [Regression](https://github.com/JaredMejia/research-fall-20/blob/master/practical-deep-learning-course/lesson-6-multilabelclassify-lesson-6-notes.md)
  - learned how to solve problems of image regression in fastai, specifically creating a key point model
  - learned how to deal with targets that are coordinates
  - learned which loss functions to use in different situations
    - `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` for single-label classification
    - `nn.BSEWithLogitsLoss` for multi-label classification
    - `nn.MSELoss` for regression
- worked on the raycasting simulation problem
  - began saving labelled images to be used to train a model meant to predict which direction to move in the simulation based on an image
  - trained initial model and tested on the simulation to navigate the camera around the maze
    - model was able to make two turns, but ended up getting stuck in a corner switching between left/right
## Issues/Problems
- struggled to set up glfw on Windows
- my inexperience with C++ was quite a bottleneck as I tried to make changes to files for the raycasting simulation
- initial model was okay, but needs to be improved
## Plans
- finish fastai lesson 7
- figure out how to get a better working model for simulation
