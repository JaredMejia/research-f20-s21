# Report Week 11/12/20
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
- finished fastai lesson 5
  - learned about presizing and how it  results in more efficient training
  - learning about how fine tuning works and how to freeze and unfreeze the pretrained portion of the model
  - learned how to find the best learning rate in fastai
  - learned about disciriminative learning rates and how to implement this with fastai
  - learned how to enable fp16 or half-precision floating point numbers to speed up training for deeper architectures

## Issues/Problems
- besides accidentally deleting all my notes halfway through the fastai lesson, no issues this week!

## Plans
- train various models and test out different methods for learning rates and fine tuning
- continue with fastai lesson 6
