# Report Week 11/12/20
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
- trained several models on the task of pet breeds (mix of different kinds of dogs and cats)
  - practiced using `Learner.lr_find()` to choose the best learning rate
  - practiced using `Learner.unfreeze()` to unfreeze layers from pretraining during transfer learning
  - practiced using discriminative learning rates
  - experimented with different architectures
- finished first half of fastai lesson 6 on [multi-label classification](https://github.com/JaredMejia/research-fall-20/blob/master/practical-deep-learning-course/lesson-6-multilabelclassify-lesson-6-notes.md)
  - learned how to construct `DataBlock`s from `DataFrame`s
  - learned about the Binary Cross-Entropy loss funtion for one-hot-encoded targets
  - learned how to accuracy metric for multiple-label classification and apply Python's partial function to set default threshold values
## Issues/Problems
- no issues this week
## Plans
- finish fastai lesson 6 and begin lesson 7
