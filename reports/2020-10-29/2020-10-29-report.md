# Report Week 10/29/20
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
- [finished Lesson 4 of fastai](https://github.com/JaredMejia/research-fall-20/edit/master/practical-deep-learning-course/lesson-4-mnist-basics/lesson-4-notes.md)
  - gained some more practice working with PyTorch modules
    - `nn.Sequential`, `nn.ReLU`, `nn.Linear`
  - learned how fastai `Learner` class works behind the scenes
  - learned how to design layers in fastai and specify nonlinearities
  - learned the basics of neural networks from a different perspective (fastai's filter)
  - built classifer two distinguish between 3 and 7 from MNIST
- began working on classifier for entire MNIST data set
## Issues/Problems
- got a little stuck when creating my classifier for the entire MNIST data set, but I'll work on this more this coming week
## Plans
- finish implementing my own classifier for entire MNIST data set
  - create multiple variations of model (different loss functions, nonlinearities, etc.)
- do fastai lesson 5
- get practice reading research papers (relevant to project)
