# Report Week 3/16/21
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
* worked on making various changes to the Automation script in an effort to generate the cleanest dataset possible for training while still maintaining adequate level of noise
  * primarily, focused on the precision of the decisions made by the autogenerater especially in areas near corners
* handled various edge cases which may accumulate to enough 'wrongly' labeled images having an impact on the performance of the model.

## Issues/Problems
* had some wifi issues this week
* there are a few bugs I still need to fix

## Plans
* fix remaining few bugs and retrain once again
* perhaps move on to next level of simulation?
