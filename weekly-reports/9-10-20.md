## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
* Installed UE 4.25
  *	My machine doesn’t meet the requisites for the software, but I was still able to play around with it a little
  * I did a few of the built in tutorials, mostly just getting a feel for the interface
  * I played around specifically with the ‘Game’ template, which I believe could be a great starting point for our project since it allows you to easily setup a game style format where you as a user are in control of some object
    * As you can see in the image below, I was really getting the hang of things in this template

    * We could use the ‘Game’ template as a start for building our robot, especially since it already offers two different camera views for you to see the virtual world through when you are playing the game
    *	We could record the data from the decisions we make moving the robot around when faced with different obstacles and objects in the view of (us as) the robot
## Issues/Problems
* My main issue was that UE 4.25 was painfully slow on my machine, which made things frustrating as I wasn’t sure whether some lagging movements in the virtual environment were because of how the physics worked and was built in the environment, or whether it was simply my machine having trouble catching up with UE. Additionally, there were often times where my mouse cursor would simply disappear while I was using the editor—obviously not ideal.
## Plans
* I’m hoping there is a chance for me to be able to work on a different machine which does meet the specifications of UE 4.25 in order for me to accelerate my learning process working with the software and hence get the chance to make rapid progress in the project
* In the case where I have to wait for a different machine, or I am left to use my machine, I will find ways around the problem, and hopefully still be able to fully utilize the software, perhaps learning from documentation and other’s experiences on how to best use the editor, rather than testing everything through the editor on my computer, in order to optimize my time spent towards the project
* I also would like to continue reading research articles on the topics of transfer learning from simulation, imitation learning, computer vision, and deep learning overall in order to learn from those who have already done work in this area in hopes that knowledge of their work will allow me to be able to accelerate our process in the project and also to easily overcome any tricky problems which have already been solved by researchers.
## Article Summaries
[Deep Convolutional Neural Networks with Transfer Learning for Computer Vision Based Data Driven Pavement Distress Detection](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kasthurirangan_Gopalakrishnan/publication/319952138_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_with_transfer_learning_for_computer_vision-based_data-driven_pavement_distress_detection/links/59c7e240458515548f37bd8a/Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-with-transfer-learning-for-computer-vision-based-data-driven-pavement-distress-detection.pdf)
The paper stressed the effectiveness of employing a pre-trained deep learning network, in this case trained on ImageNet, on the classification task of pavement distress detection. While reading, I tried to think of some of the methods that might be applied to our task of training a robot to be able to make decisions while navigating difficult terrain. While in this paper, the task was a classification one, ours is most likely going to be much different since it requires decision making and malleable environments, though perhaps at some level there is a sort of classification going on in our case where a certain situation, for example an arrangement of obstacles in the field of view, must be classified or diagnosed in order for the optimal decision to be made. Regardless, it was encouraging to see the effectiveness of pre-training and then transfer learning with fine tuning when approaching a computer vision problem. The pre-training in our case will for the most part take place in the simulation within UE, though I wonder if we could perhaps enhance the learning of that model, and hence do a sort of pre-pre-training, if we are to start with a model trained on images of different terrain in order to allow for the ability to cluster different environmental situations based on visual cues. Furthermore, it seems to me that more data will in most cases yield better results, so I’m curious what would be the best ways to augment data, that is the information absorbed by training within the simulation based on human decisions, using Unreal Engine.
