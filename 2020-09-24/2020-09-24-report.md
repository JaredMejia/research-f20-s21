[Semantic Object Classes in Video: A high-definition ground truth database](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/G.Brostow/papers/Brostow_2009-PRL.pdf)
Video labeled data can be used to leverage motion cues for recognition, detection, and segmentation, and of course to evaluate existing video algorithms quantitatively. Algorithms which take advantage of spatial and temporal context will likely perform much better than still images. The CamVid Database is one of the only video-based database with per-pixel ground truth for multiple clases, consisting of HD original video sequences, intrinsic calibration, camera pose trajectories, the list of class labels and pseudo-colors, the hand labeled frames, and the stroke logs for the hand labeled frames. InteractLabeler is the software program developed to assist the labelers of the CamVid Database and it can also be used to label image sequences or video files for any other domain in order to produce ground truth for researchers' data in applications relating to object recognition, tracking and segmentation. 

Potentially, we could use transfer learning on a model trained from the CamVid Database in order to train our model to be able to deal with segmentation in our simulated environment, which could possibly allow our robot to make even 'smarter' decisions than those it would make using only a model trained on image classification.
